
fuction LoRa_tx_new is used for generating packet for SF=8. 
fuction LoRa_demod_1 is used for performing dechirping and FFT after windowing for complete packet. 
Main code LoRa_one_complete_packet_decoding perform packet generation with CSS modulation. After demodulation, peak extraction algorithm has been implemented in this code for decoding.
